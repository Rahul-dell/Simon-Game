Hi, This is a Simon Game (self made from scratch, as part of learning).
I hope you will enjoy it. It need memory and also need to process data of imagery and sound.
OOPS ! I am sorry to say that I thought to make it from scratch but couldn't (only in javascript's logical part)  so went through the steps and guidance of my teacher.
Finally after many dry runs and testing, it is completed...
